				<h2> Professional Summary </h2>				
				
				<p>
					I started my academic journey in <span class="highlight">Mechatronic Engineering</span> at UPC in Lima, Peru, 
					where I discovered how much I enjoy combining <span class="highlight">technology, problem-solving, and creativity</span>. 
					That experience inspired me to focus more on programming and data analysis. After moving to Canada, 
					I completed certifications in <span class="highlight">Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, and Cloud Computing</span>, 
					which strengthened both my technical and analytical thinking. I am now studying for a 
					<span class="highlight">Bachelor of Computer Information Systems</span> at Okanagan College to deepen my knowledge in 
					Software Development, Databases, and Data-Driven systems.
				</p>

				<p>
				  Over time, I've built strong skills in <span class="highlight">Python, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS</span>, 
				  and I've applied them in real projects involving data analysis and web development. Working at 
				  <span class="highlight">Jealous Fruits Ltd.</span> taught me how to use data to improve efficiency while leading bilingual teams 
				  and communicating clearly between workers and management. At Martes Digital, I developed website components 
				  and coded new features that made client platforms faster and more functional. These experiences taught me the 
				  value of combining teamwork, technology, and creativity to make a positive impact.
				</p>

				<p>
				  My goal is to build a career that connects <span class="highlight">software development and data analysis</span> to design smarter and more useful digital solutions. 
				  I'm passionate about learning new technologies, improving how systems work, and applying my skills to real-world challenges. 
				  I hope to continue growing in Canada's tech industry, where I can contribute ideas that make technology more accessible 
				  and meaningful for people.
