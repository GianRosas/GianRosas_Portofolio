					<li>Hands-on experience in quality assurance and data analysis, performing detailed assessments on fruit defects, size, and color, while implementing data-driven tools that enabled supervisors to make real-time decisions and improve production workflows.</li>
					<li>Technical expertise in programming and data analysis, with proficiency in Python, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and visualization tools like IBM Cognos. Experienced in data wrangling, cleaning, visualization, dashboarding, and predictive analysis.</li>
					<li>Practical knowledge of tools and methodologies, including MySQL, Firmtech, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, Microsoft Office, Agile, Scrum, and Waterfall project management.</li>
					<li>Web development background as a Junior Developer at Martes Digital, where I optimized WordPress websites, coded custom features in JavaScript and Python, and improved client satisfaction through enhanced functionality and performance.</li>
					<li>Certified in Data Analytics, AI, and Cloud Fundamentals (IBM Data Analyst, Microsoft Azure AI, NPower Junior Data Analyst Program), complemented by academic Self-own studies and studies in Computer Information Systems and Mechatronic Engineering.</li>
					<li>Proven leadership and teamwork abilities through professional and volunteer experiences, mentoring colleagues, supporting quality teams, and leading youth programs at YMCA and BBVA that fostered creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
					I started my academic journey in <span class="highlight">Mechatronic Engineering</span> at UPC in Lima, Peru, 
					where I discovered how much I enjoy combining <span class="highlight">technology, problem-solving, and creativity</span>. 
					That experience inspired me to focus more on programming and data analysis. After moving to Canada, 
					I completed certifications in <span class="highlight">Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, and Cloud Computing</span>, 
					which strengthened both my technical and analytical thinking. I am now studying for a 
					<span class="highlight">Bachelor of Computer Information Systems</span> at Okanagan College to deepen my knowledge in 
					Software Development, Databases, and Data-Driven systems.
				</p>

				<p>
				  Over time, I've built strong skills in <span class="highlight">Python, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS</span>, 
				  and I've applied them in real projects involving data analysis and web development. Working at 
				  <span class="highlight">Jealous Fruits Ltd.</span> taught me how to use data to improve efficiency while leading bilingual teams 
				  and communicating clearly between workers and management. At Martes Digital, I developed website components 
				  and coded new features that made client platforms faster and more functional. These experiences taught me the 
				  value of combining teamwork, technology, and creativity to make a positive impact.
				</p>

				<p>
				  My goal is to build a career that connects <span class="highlight">software development and data analysis</span> to design smarter and more useful digital solutions. 
				  I'm passionate about learning new technologies, improving how systems work, and applying my skills to real-world challenges. 
				  I hope to continue growing in Canada's tech industry, where I can contribute ideas that make technology more accessible 
				  and meaningful for people.
